                                    Being a new player in Counter Strike 2 can
                                    be difficult. Likely you will experience
                                    mean players, unkind words, and many lost
                                    rounds. This guide will help alleviate some
                                    of these problems but not all of them.

                                    cosmetics that you can apply to your weapons
                                    and gloves. They do not provide a
                                    competitive advantage, but are visually
                                    appealing. Rare skins are sought after by
                                    the players and can be bought and sold for
                                    real money.

                                    added to the game in the form of larger
                                    collections. Collections are packages of
                                    skins for multiple different weapons that
                                    are added at once. There are eight different

                                    In order to open a case players need to
                                    purchase a key, which costs $2.49. Players
                                    will then see an animation (similar to a
                                    slot machine) which determines which skin
                                    they get from the case. Skins can then be
                                    resold on the Steam market for real money.

                                    Some gun skins have patterns. A pattern
                                    based skin has a giant picture with 1000
                                    little areas. Each area has a number
                                    associated with it, called an index. When a
                                    skin is dropped it is assigned one of these
                                    indices, which correspond with the part of
                                    the pattern that will be displayed on the

                                    based on what you and your team did that
                                    round. For example getting kills, planting
                                    the bomb, defusing the bomb, and surviving a
                                    round will all award money. The amount

                                    will go through each aspect of earning
                                    money.

                                    You will earn money based on how many

                                    money based on how many teammates you kill
                                    as well. In short kills are multipliers for
                                    money. Each weapon earns a different amount
                                    of money but the number of kills multiplies
                                    that amount.

                                    Each weapon also earns different amounts of
                                    money. The general rule is that the more
                                    difficult it is to get a kill with a
                                    specific weapon, the more money you will
                                    earn for a single kill. For example, it is
                                    hard to kill an enemy with a shotgun since
                                    they have to be close and you have to be
                                    lucky with the spread of bullets so the
                                    award for a kill is $900. This is in
                                    contrast to an 1-hit kill sniper rifle that
                                    is effective at nearly every range with an
                                    award of $100.

                                    Callouts are a verbal description from your
                                    teamates or you that helps target the
                                    position of enemies, guns, and teamates.
                                    Callouts are an important part of the game
                                    that help you effectively communicate with
                                    your teamates and be prepared for fights.
                                    Every map shares basic callouts with other
                                    maps as well as a maps personalized
                                    callouts.

                                    These callouts are widly used on almost
                                    every map in the game and are a good
                                    starting point for callouts to learn.
                                    Callouts become harder as they get more
                                    personalized with each map because it gets
                                    harder to remember details on every map. The
                                    community may rename callouts for various
                                    reasons making it important to communicate
                                    to other players to understand where their
                                    callouts are. An easy start to making
                                    callouts is to follow a basic format like:
                                </p>
                                <ul>

                                        "Area/site" + "detailed spot in the
                                        area"
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Example: "A ramp" the A site Ramp</li>
                                    <li>
                                        Example: "Connector" Area that connects
                                        A and B sites
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Example: "B Tunnels" A covered area near
                                        B site
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                                    Callouts are a great tool to use and will
                                    help you win games. It's important to play
                                    and get experienced with the maps to better
                                    understand and make callouts.

                                    Skybox and boundaries
                                </h3>
                                <p>
                                    The Skybox and boundaries are very important
                                    part of the maps that players should learn
                                    about. A Skybox is a cube that surrounds
                                    that map with invisible borders that keep
                                    people and items inside the map. However CS2
                                    is a little different with no verticle
                                    SkyBox or "ceilling" to the map. This allows
                                    player to throw utility in the sky and have
                                    it not bounce back down from an invisible
                                    barrier. The video below shows the use of
                                    the skybox and how combining utility with
                                    the map is very useful.

                                    Boundaries on the map likes walls and boards
                                    are useful to bounce utility off of and to
                                    shoot through to get ahead of an enemies.
                                    Shooting through a wall is called
                                    "WallBanging" and works for certain
                                    surfaces. For example, players can shoot
                                    through doors, cars, wood pallets, corners
                                    of walls, and thin walls. This can be very
                                    useful when you know where someone is or
                                    want to stop enemies from peeking angles.
